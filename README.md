## Description

A small website to show the current phase of the moon.

Currently I intend to use very basic HTML, css, javascript to build this.
I shouldn't need anything more complex for such a simple concept.

To see the current site, visit [https://brstrutt.github.io/MoonPhase/](https://brstrutt.github.io/MoonPhase/).
